      "251 mr president i am forced to take a trip eleven years down memory lane since it was in fact in 1991 that the council of ministers for the environment adopted a directive to be discussed this evening concerning the placing of plant protection products on the market the aim of this directive was firstly to define a common evaluation procedure of active substances for both existing and new pesticides and secondly to establish a positive list of authorised substances which are deemed to be acceptable for health and the environment a positive list means that any substance that does not feature on this list is essentially banned twelve years was chosen as the period in which to complete this considerable undertaking which of course gives us until july 2003 in the meantime however the commission was required under article 8 to publish a progress report on the procedure this report was in fact published at the end of last year and this is what forms the basis of this evening's debate\n",
      "\n",
      "252 the new integrated farming policy that is emerging in the european union has led to a considerable decrease in the use of plant protection products for example in some farms such as extensive arable farms the public has not appreciated this and is not sufficiently aware of it the public is increasingly sensitive to the theories of environmentalists which if they are upheld could lead to undesirable effects on biodiversity due to accumulation as a result of a lack of protection on small farms this could cause serious problems in terms of lack of supply and dependency and could prevent us from seeking solutions for essential uses and lead us to establish parameters that are beyond the limits determined by analysis or to have plant protection products evaluated by interested ngos interested in what and why i wonder technical evaluations are done by scientists and discussed between scientists\n",
      "\n",
      "253 mr president more than 10 years ago directive 91414 concerning the authorisation use and control of plant protection products entered into force admittedly it was clear beforehand that the implementation of this directive would be a complex task but you will agree with me that the fruits of 10 years of labour are very disappointing indeed less than four percent of all active ingredients that need to be assessed have fully undergone the procedure at this rate the task will not be completed until the 22nd century \n",
      "\n",
      "254 furthermore it appears that a number of important assessment aspects have been overlooked the use of additives which boost the effect of plant protection products springs to mind for example agriculture in the netherlands adds 1 500 tonnes of chemical additives to 3 600 tonnes of pesticides annually the effect of which on the public and the environment is unknown in addition an assessment criterion for drinking water originating from surface water is lacking practice has shown that the pursuit of the sustainable production of drinking water is hindered by the lack of sustainability in the use of plant protection products these are just two examples illustrating that the present community framework for plant protection products leaves something to be desired \n",
      "\n",
      "255 given the current state of affairs we are unfortunately forced to extend the evaluation deadlines for plant protection products only in this way can we get the difficult process of the past 10 years back on track i should like to bring three important points to your attention \n",
      "\n",
      "256 first of all harmful substances must be phased out as soon as possible with the time when the new period sets in applying as the latest date further delays are in my view highly undesirable secondly we must exercise restraint when granting exemptions thirdly we must ensure that the conditions we have prescribed for extending the assessment periods are actually observed herein lies an important monitoring role for parliament in short i call for consistent action when it comes to authorising using and controlling plant protection products within europe \n",
      "\n",
      "257 i just want to give the committee one example of this ad hominem arguments are always dangerous but i have a producer in my own area who turned to a particular plant protection range of products because he was himself alarmed by the effect of dangerous pesticides as he had seen them if i talk of things like agent orange you will know exactly what i mean truly harmful substances\n",
      "\n",
      "258 he has produced a product which i use myself called armilatox which is the only effective way of treating plant diseases like honey fungus there is no way he could pay the estimated cost for the assessment of that product which is in a low toxicity range it would be two or three times his annual turnover\n",
      "\n",
      "259 my intention in publishing the commission's report in august last year was twofold first to ensure greater transparency second to improve understanding of the evaluation process for plant protection products and the problems confronting the commission in meeting the impossible deadlines under the present directive\n",

      "\n",
      "267 one thing i find interesting in this connection is that with respect to ignalina we are for the first time rightly demanding something of a candidate country that cannot be found in the acquis communautaire because lamentably we have as yet no community acquis concerning the safety of nuclear power plants i consider that really to be a political scandal and i hope we will arrive at a common standard for that for the future i hear that some members of the council the usual suspects are already objecting to the closure of the plant and the reasons why they must close it being so expressly included in the accession treaty for lithuania because they are afraid that could indirectly create an acquis\n",

      "269 madam president commissioner ladies and gentlemen what actually are biofuels biofuels are fuels capable of replacing conventional fuels or of being mixed with them and which are derived from the processing or fermentation of various non fossil biological materials the reason i say this is that we should always explain what we are talking about bioethanol and biodiesel are the biofuels most in use at present whilst the two of them are virtually equally profitable they cannot compete with fuels derived from oil the profitability of biofuels is manifestly dependent on the one hand on producing the maximum quantity from the best quality production process and on the other on its price while i am on the subject of biodiesel i would like to mention that it is derived from plant oils rapeseed sunflower soya and palm for example which are mainly grown in regions of the eu and can also be used as animal feedingstuffs\n",

      "271 the amendments adopted in the committee on agriculture seek to make this directive more effective by emphasising that the by products of biofuels produced in the european union provide materials that are rich in plant protein which can be used in animal feed by abolishing the totally arbitrary limit of 50 of the tax differential by abolishing the time limit of 31 december 2010 since the external costs in the oil sector are permanent by applying complete tax exemption to fuels used in biofuel production which is already the case in the manufacture of oil products by pointing out that cuts in excise duty can only apply to biofuels produced in the european union otherwise the european union would not benefit from either reduced greenhouse gas emissions or from protein fodder crops that are produced as a by product\n",

      "285 it is understandable why members are concerned in the eu at the present time we have a 35 million tonne annual shortfall in plant proteins this situation has been exacerbated by the continuing mbm meat and bone meal ban which has created a further 2 million tonne hole in our protein supply eu self sufficiency in plant proteins has fallen to 23 placing the community in a position of great vulnerability we now have an enormous reliance on imported proteins from outside the eu most of it comes from america argentina and brazil in the form of soya cake much of it is genetically modified clearly such heavy reliance on sources outside our control makes the eu vulnerable to sudden price rises climate change or harvest failures in these countries almost placing our livestock sector in the same position as our heavy industry once was at the time of the oil crisis\n",
      "\n",
      "286 there is a further alarming factor which will inevitably add to our problems currently the accession states are more than 80 self sufficient in plant proteins while this is a considerable improvement on the situation in the 15 member states it remains the case that the accession states for the most part export their oil seed because their crushing mills are obsolete meaning that they still have to import soya cake in large quantities for their livestock sector however the commission is forecasting a fall in plant protein production in these countries once they become full members of the eu and a switch to cereals this would be disastrous we have a ready made market for oil seeds and protein crops from which the accession states could benefit greatly on the other hand an increase in cereal production would simply add to the overall surplus and lead to the introduction of higher set aside rates we must implement a plan which would encourage the production of rape seed pulses sunflower and soya and provide major economic benefits not only to the accession states but to ourselves through greater self sufficiency\n",
      "\n",
      "287 so it is against this background that i have set out in my report to look for ways of encouraging more self reliance within the eu amongst many recommendations i have suggested various ways of encouraging an increase in plant protein production by investing more in research into and development of new and improved plant varieties i have also called for rotational aid payments to farmers to encourage the production of plant proteins in the cereal crop cycle and for the growing of protein crops grain legumes and oil seeds on set aside land i have called for a safety net or income insurance scheme for producers of oil seed and protein crops\n",

      "288 since the presentation of our report we have continued our reflections not only on plant proteins but indeed across the board this culminated in the mid term review of the eu's common agricultural policy presented by the commission on 10 july 2002 the commission is of the opinion that public expenditure in the farm sector must be better justified besides supporting farming incomes it must yield more in return in terms of food quality conservation of the environment and animal welfare the countryside and the farming landscape and enhancing social balance and equity for eu consumers and taxpayers the review should ensure better value for money we will be discussing these proposals in the autumn\n",

      "289  mr president commissioner ladies and gentlemen this report seeks to express the european parliament's position on the commission communication on options for the plant protein sector given the two million tonne increase in the shortfall resulting from the ban on the use of animal meal in the european union\n",
      "\n",
      "290 the enormous risk that we are running in the european union in terms of competitiveness is therefore easy to see from the fact that sectors as important as these meat and milk are ultimately dependent on our main competitors this does not make sense the solution to this problem must involve three main measures in line in fact with the rapporteur's proposals the first is to end the area limits imposed by blair house with the current wto agreements coming to an end and with the alignment of oilseed aid to that of cereals from the beginning of the current season there are clearly no more reasons for self imposed limits the second reason or the second measure is that due to the excessive deficit specifically in the plant protein sector the current increase in aid must be maintained or if possible increased with this aid differential and without the area limits the semi area imposed by blair house we will be able to improve our situation within a few years and the third reason also mentioned in the report is that a review must be undertaken of the ban on fishmeal in ruminant feeds following a proper scientific study\n",
      "\n",
      "291 to conclude i wish to state that in addition to the importance of plant proteins in the european union's food production chain we must stress the strategic importance of these crops in the european union's mediterranean areas where the choice of crops is limited and where above all there are few crops that provide farmers with options but where these particular crops adapt very well to the unproductive land and the predominant soil in these areas which is poor limited and marginal it would therefore be necessary to extend the range of eligible crops as the rapporteur also states because it is incredible and unacceptable that the main varieties of plant proteins from the mediterranean regions are not currently eligible for aid this situation must be reviewed lastly i would like to add that we also need to see what the relationship is between this commission communication and the new proposals for a mid term review of the cap which provide for a separate production aid system\n",
      "\n",
      "292 the issue of plant protein supply for the european union obviously involves economic factors but also and more importantly it involves strategic aspects relating to the nature of the european agricultural model and the role played by this model in external trade we should be aware that we import almost 80 of the plant proteins required to fulfil our needs and that this heavy reliance cannot be approached solely from the point of view of the commercial interests at the time aside from the current matter of gmos in imported soya proteins we must ask ourselves what would happen in europe if for whatever reason whether due to climate or other reasons the supply from the united states brazil and argentina were to be cut off commissioner those affected by the american embargo in 1973 as i was are aware of the price of this reliance and cannot tolerate the level of risks run today paradoxically although demand is high in europe production here is stagnating or even decreasing and the worst thing is that the european union does not seem determined to remedy this situation properly of course we can examine your proposals on the introduction of a 'carbon credit' which are a step in the right direction the impact of this credit could however be limited by its small scale and discontinuing the use of set aside land for non food crops might not be compensated for by the move towards some energy crops being produced by workers' cooperatives the various measures you are advocating on behalf of the commission to adapt agenda 2000 to current needs do not seem sufficient to address the current problems this failure is both serious and regrettable without going so far as to set the unrealistic objective of total self sufficiency the european union could still reduce its reliance on external suppliers\n",
      "\n",
      "293 that commissioner is why i ask you to examine more carefully the recommendations of the stevenson report which i indeed we find relevant they were unanimously approved by the committee on agriculture and rural development i recommend in particular that you pay attention to those advocating greater investment in research into the protein sector under the 6th frdp and those concerning the introduction of plant protein producing crops in cereal crop rotation i believe the same applies to the security of our long term supply and the promotion of sustainable agriculture\n",
      "\n",
      "294 mr president commissioner i would first of all thank mr stevenson for a particularly thorough report i agree with the conclusions and the diagnosis it is therefore cause for concern that eu self sufficiency in plant proteins has fallen to below 23 market related price relationships have made it advantageous to buy imported oilseed cake especially soya meal but climatic risks and changes to production in those countries from which we supply ourselves make the eu all too vulnerable the eu therefore needs to increase its self sufficiency by cultivating oil bearing plants and i am also able to endorse the various initiatives put forward by the rapporteur in his report nor shall i omit to alert the commission to the fact that the arrangements made specifically impair the european grain market by making it possible to import cheap grain from russia and that they simply contribute to making plant production less profitable financially at the same time the lower grain prices in europe give rise to an increase in pig breeding which in turn requires higher imports of soya meal this initiative therefore promotes neither european plant cultivation nor european production of proteins\n",
      "\n",
      "295 mr president ladies and gentlemen commissioner i congratulate mr stevenson on the report he has presented and which deserves our support as the document we are now debating states the european union's current rate of self sufficiency in vegetable proteins has fallen to below 23 as other members have already said and which becomes all the more serious when you realise that at world level plant protein production has increased by 60 in the last fifteen years and is largely concentrated in three countries\n",
      "\n",
      "296 it is therefore hard to understand the commission position of insisting on depending almost solely on the world market with the aggravating circumstance that this supply is concentrated in three countries and i would remind you that one of these is the united states of america i would also take this opportunity to remind you of that country's agricultural policy which is not only in competition with the european union but which is also protectionist this fact puts the european union in an extremely vulnerable position and is not a sustainable response to our needs in terms of plant proteins as the rapporteur points out in his report\n",
      "\n",
      "297 it is therefore important that we encourage the development of plant protein production in the european union which will help to make us less dependent on imports and to ensure the multifunctionality of community agriculture introducing other species and varieties of grain legumes which have inexplicably been excluded from community support and from the improvement plans i would remind you of yellow lupin and other species that have traditionally been used for animal feed particularly in the mediterranean countries and which have not benefited from community support\n",
      "\n",
      "298 hence the importance of granting rotational aid to farmers to encourage the production of plant proteins in the cereal crop cycle using fallow land as we have advocated in other reports and also the need to terminate the blair house agreements or at the very least renegotiate them it is hard to understand why no effort has yet been made to renegotiate them in the aim of terminating them thereby making greater direct aid possible for the protection of proteins in the european union\n",

      "299 we believe it is equally important for the commission to approve the additional aid for plant proteins beans peas and lupins not covered by the blair house agreements and we support the terms referred to in the report by the our rapporteur we hope then that the commission will take account of these proposals whilst respecting the principle of monitoring production and the positive effects of these in both the socio economic and the environmental fields i would also remind you that now when it comes to revising the cap neither this report nor the proposals that will surely be approved here in the european parliament must be forgotten\n",

      "302 this situation makes a european protein plan urgently necessary in order to promote the cultivation of protein plants thereby reducing our dependence on imports and giving us more varied sources of supply i would bring to your attention the fact that the eu the most significant importer in the world gets by far and away most of its plant proteins from the usa argentina and brazil and that these are very often genetically modified ones\n",
      "\n",
      "303 our concern here is not only with the cultivation of soya and rape but to an equal degree with seed flax camelina and many other plant proteins it is for that reason that i attach particular importance to the products' traceability in order for transparency to give consumers choice quality and confidence that the food is safe over and above this the cultivation of protein rich cultures contributes to the diversity of crop rotation by making it possible to reduce input and by preventing the rise of monocultures\n",
      "\n",
      "304 if it were possible to utilise set aside areas that would be a practical approach whilst of course safeguarding budget neutrality it is not only cultivation of organic areas that needs to be promoted as the commission proposes but conventional agriculture should also have the opportunity to cultivate plant proteins fodder legumes and so on in their fields benefiting from the eu's environmental programmes\n",
      "\n",
      "305 the production of oilseeds for use in biofuels and building materials gives in fact further significant impetus to agriculture what i seek at the international level is for the blair house agreement to be at last seriously reconsidered and for all parties to see the urgent necessity of facilitating the production of plant protein in the eu in accordance with the regulations i do believe that a genuinely serious discussion on this has to be set in train at european level for we are well aware that biofuels are environmentally friendly and can also be produced without prior energy input whilst remaining within the financial framework the eu needs to promote the use of plants in protein production with the minimum possible delay in order to secure an independent supply of protein for farmers and european agriculture facilitate energy generation and thus reduce our dependence on fossil energy we are all aware that europe imports something like 60 of its energy\n",

      "\n",
      "307 the commission ought to accept this extremely representative vote and this unity of position because mr fischler the position of the european parliament is quite clearly reflected in paragraph 3 which says 'the european parliament recommends that the development of eu plant protein production should be encouraged to reduce its reliance on imports and to sustain the multi functionality of community agriculture'\n",
      "\n",

      "368 mr president commissioner i would like to start by thanking the rapporteur my fellow member mrs auroi for this report i welcome the commission's proposal to simplify matters by drawing together and streamlining ten directives on the community comparative tests for twenty five years comparative tests on arable crops have been carried out in the community on the basis of relevant legal provisions the scope of these tests has further increased substantially in recent years this system of follow up controls is seen as a very important instrument to harmonise the marketing conditions in the member states and is therefore also endorsed in the internal market these comparative tests must not however be restricted to those seed and plant varieties that have so far been certified and listed in the union's common catalogue there must also in my view be a quite specific way of dealing with seed designated for use in organic farming\n",
      "\n",
      "369 the request to ensure the inclusion in the community comparative trials of organically produced seed and seed falling in the area of plant genetic resources deserves consideration however the proposal to take specific measures in these areas has to be carefully considered to avoid any risk of overlapping with measures already in place for this reason amendments 2 4 5 6 and the relevant parts of amendments 12 to 17 19 to 21 and 24 to 29 are acceptable subject to re wording\n",
      "\n",
      "370 allow me now to turn to the important issue of the adventitious and technically unavoidable presence of gmos in seeds of conventional plant varieties this is a totally different matter to the issue of comparative trials that we are discussing here today it is therefore being addressed in another proposal in the context of the directives on the marketing of seeds a proposal for a commission directive is being prepared which will aim to set thresholds in this regard\n",
      "\n",
      "371 the leaves of stevia and the sweetener extracted from this plant stevioside have also been thoroughly examined by the scientific committee on food the committee has serious doubts about the safety of stevioside and did not consider it as acceptable for use in food therefore the commission has never proposed this sweetener for authorisation to date no new scientific data justifying a re evaluation of stevioside have been presented to the commission\n",
      "\n",
      "372 madam president commissioner i am glad that we have the opportunity today to speak on the subject of this directive not so much out of any personal attachment to detergent issues but quite simply because this report also shows that the european union is moving towards abandoning the end of life policy and instead to an increasing extent seeking to develop modern and environmentally friendly products that are economically and socially sustainable that means that we want to motivate industry to move progressively to other products and at the end of the line no longer to rely on the catalytic converter or on the waste treatment plant or on big exhaust systems instead right at the start of the process we want to move on to new products that are sustainable\n",

      "373 report a5 00782003 by danielle auroi on behalf of the committee on agriculture and rural development on the proposal for a council directive amending directives 66401eec on the marketing of fodder plant seed 66402eec on the marketing of cereal seed 68193eec on the marketing of material for the vegetative propagation of the vine 9233eec on the marketing of vegetable propagating and planting material other than seed 9234eec on the marketing of propagating and planting material of fruit plants 9856ec on the marketing of propagating material of ornamental plants 200254ec on the marketing of beet seed 200255ec on the marketing of vegetable seed 200256ec on the marketing of seed potatoes and 200257ec on the marketing of seed of oil and fibre plants as regards community comparative tests and trials com2002 523 c5 04762002 20020232cns \n",

      "374 all possible steps must be taken to preserve the biodiversity of cultivated plants left to free competition alone genetic selection tends to be concentrated among a few companies the number of varieties placed on the market is restricted and local varieties disappear seed producers naturally tend to favour captive hybrid or genetically modified varieties which allow them to be sure that their produce will be viable it is therefore incumbent upon the member states to maintain the public service dimension in plant selection ensure that local varieties under threat are preserved and allow the production of farm seed\n",
      "\n",
      "375 lastly we must be extremely cautious with regard to coating seeds with plant health products a technique which can be harmful to the environment and to wildlife this is particularly true of coatings containing powerful systemic insecticides which have disastrous effects on pollinating insects in particular domestic bees\n",
      "\n",
      "376 the compromise amendments represent good progress in terms of reaching a final agreement and it is significant that the existence of different technologies throughout the length and breadth of the european union has been recognised it is the case that the more heat a plant produces the greater the global efficiency of the cogeneration process but to reduce the whole directive to this statement is simplistic and unrealistic\n",
      "\n",
      "377 a plant for the exclusive production of heat with an efficiency of 80 is entirely inefficient i would even go as far as to say obsolete but a plant for the production of electricity with an efficiency of 50 may be very efficient and why is all of this the case for the simple reason that electricity is a more elaborate form of energy which is obtained from heat\n",
      "\n",
      "378 once it is made clear that the global efficiency of the plant is not an appropriate or absolute parameter for determining the value of cogeneration what are we left with we are left as i believe mr vidal quadras will also point out with primary energy savings and consequently gas emissions savings this is the most appropriate parameter for measuring the benefits derived from cogeneration when compared to the separate production of heat and electricity\n",
      "\n",
      "379 let me turn to the definitions definitions might be thought to be technical in nature but in fact politics lurks behind the technology annex ii is about determining which current in a cogeneration plant is actually cogenerated electricity this definition is independent of climate zones there can be only one definition and it must apply throughout europe if such is not the case we are opening the way to distortions of competition in the european internal market the amendments that mr vidal quadras roca intends to bring in tomorrow do not help in this respect and should be voted out\n",
      "\n",
      "380 the amendments relating to micro generation renewable energy sources and district cooling are important in terms of technological development it is possible to store heat in all size categories for a day or a year as opposed to what is stated in the commission proposal and in certain committee opinions financial support should not be restricted just to chp technology based on a useful heat demand flexibility in the use of chp plants must be permitted as dictated by the time of year the working day and random variables waste heat produced at a cogeneration plant has a potentially wider use than is the case at present it may also be used for example for cooling water purification and air conditioning\n",
      "\n",
      "381 whatever happens we want to see the ambitious objective laid down that the proportion of the total electricity generated in the european union by cogeneration plants should be doubled rising from 9 as it was in 1994 to 18 in 2012 we need transparent rules on what can be promoted as a cogeneration plant rules that must be applicable throughout the european union the two stage procedure proposed by the commission with its classification of energy for agriculture industry and heating does not provide that transparency instead it simply demands an excessive burden of administration it is for that reason that we want to impose as standard an index figure for electricity and 80 efficiency that at any rate is what the environment committee has decided in addition cogeneration plants with an output of over 50 megawatts should also fall within the maximum aid envisaged by the eu there is no doubt that the limit proposed by the commission is set too low even small cogeneration plants can produce 100 megawatts or even more small and medium sized plants ensure decentralised implementation which can certainly make for effectiveness in terms of protection of the environment we must do more to counteract increasing global warming and a cleverly conceived directive on cogeneration plants can certainly help to do that\n",
      "\n",
      "382 i would like to refer to some concerns expressed by a company in my former constituency and now the south west region that i represent they tell me they have supplied co generation plant over the past 20 years which has contributed to an estimated annual saving of 700 000 tonnes of carbon which is a significant saving they are concerned about this 50 megawatt threshold for eligibility they want it to be removed as a distortion or potential distortion to investment decisions they are very keen on the test of eligibility for support to be based on primary energy savings and a point which has not yet been mentioned they want the directive to recognise and reward the benefits of utilising waste heat and fuels that can come from a variety of sources\n",
      "\n",
      "383 mr president the directive we are about to vote on can and must be clearly perceived as a turning point by the european citizens seveso the disasters with which we are sadly all familiar in the natural park of doñana and the sinking of the oil tanker the prestige and last but not least the confirmation of the devastating future health implications of the environmental degradation caused by the priolo chemical plant are all incidents which call for the establishment of a european system of civil liability for environmental damage\n",
      "\n",
      "384 it is also a good thing that this law opens the way for new electricity plant to be properly sited specifically in the vicinity of centres of consumption and not for example where the primary energy used is especially cheap thereby giving rise to massive new transport networks\n",
      "\n",
      "385 here too though we see that this must first be incorporated into a real strategy that it is not yet fully operational and that we do not yet know how it is to work as of course we have to evaluate certain of its constituent parts in relation to this what priority do we in fact give to combating terrorism and to what extent do the instruments enable us to do that the argument adduced by the americans in relation to the war in iraq was also to some degree an argument about terrorism are we ourselves clear in our own minds about the extent to which traditional military means can be deployed to combat terrorism the same applies to the area of non proliferation if we could do as for example the israelis did in iraq in the early 1980s and destroy a nuclear power plant with a single pre emptive strike thereby preventing the development of any nuclear capability could this be part of such a strategy one that might enable us with less or scarcely any loss of human life to develop capacities to prevent immense dangers and subsequent wars i believe that we have to answer these questions on this occasion i am framing them as questions but they ought to form part of a specific and consistent approach if we are to be able to put something on the table in the way that the bush administration has done where we can identify both similarities and differences and will very definitely be enabled to conduct on a stable basis the dialogue with the united states that is necessary if we are to start working together or perhaps achieve a rapprochement and that will help enable the americans to abandon unilateralism\n",
      "\n",
      "386 the council has produced a common position which essentially takes into account many of parliament's concerns but a number of grey areas still remain and these are the following firstly the inclusion of mining activities and land fill sites an issue on which the committee on the environment public health and consumer policy has decided to retable the amendments from first reading in other words the inclusion in the scope of the directive of all types of preparation and processing of dangerous substances in these sites not just chemical or thermal preparations that is as envisaged by the commission i would point out moreover that we are only talking about active plant we are aware that the commission has just recently launched a specific proposal for a directive on the management of waste from mining activities the terms of which will moreover have to be decided together with the european parliament at the appropriate time but until then there is and will continue to be a gap in the law which given the recent accidents which have alarmed public opinion cannot be tolerated however i am not excluding the possibility that the progress of the new directive on mining activities through conciliation might make it easier to reach agreement on this point\n",
      "\n",
      "387 the third question is that of urban development planning in this area the council has already taken into consideration parliament's desire to lay the foundations for definition at european level of methodological criteria which are necessary to assess compatibility between the sites in question and the areas at risk not least by means of union funding however given the great diversity of rules regional situations competences and responsibilities which characterises this aspect of safety situating plant in terms of urban development planning i believe that we must of necessity invoke the principle of subsidiarity and leave it up to the member states to decide on the minimum distances that is why i have called for a split vote on amendment no 6 and will only vote for the first part of the amendment\n",
      "\n",
      "388 for the farmer it would be a way of obtaining more added value for his product and of avoiding two lots of transactions namely the sale of his plant products and the purchase of his compound feeds it would also enable him to improve his image and go up market our environment would benefit from the obvious saving in terms of transport the lorry that comes to the farm to collect the maize or forage peas being sold and the one that comes to deliver the compound feed\n",
      "\n",
      "389 secondly gmos pose two major risks the first of these concerns human health there is a risk that the transgene introduced into the plant may code for the synthesis of a toxic protein the mad cow disease prion has demonstrated that certain undesirable proteins may have very long term toxic effects the second risk concerns the environment this is the risk that undesirable genes will be spread to the wild flora and to the rhizosphere on this point one can only deplore the extremely unwise conduct of the americans who have spread gmos over millions of hectares without having taken the precaution of accurately evaluating this risk\n",
      "\n",
      "390 madam president it is high time that the european union opened up more to biotechnologies and genetic engineering in the food sector as well since the 1980s plant transgenesis technology has been making progress everywhere except in europe last year about 60 million hectares outside europe were growing genetically improved crops the european union is having difficulty in protecting about 10 000 hectares for the experimental cultivation of certain transgenic plants\n",
      "\n",
      "391 allow me to quote the french académie des sciences which says 'transgenic varieties have been rejected in europe although there has never been a health problem regarding consumers or damage to the environment' the académie goes on to explain that almost all the plants cultivated today are the result of thousands of years of genetic selection from wild plants gene exchanges between varieties or species have very often led to profound changes in the morphology of the original wild plant many species have been domesticated by man by the addition of different genomes examples of this include tobacco wheat and rape\n",
      "\n",
      "392 since it is impossible to determine the precise contamination range of pollen produced by a genetically modified plant it will be in the interest of the producers of these plants to have good insurance unless they are able to train bees to gather pollen very selectively\n",
      "\n",
      "393 with regard to biphenyl orthophenyl phenol and sodium orthophenyl phenol which will now be classed as plant protection products the commission's intention is to include them in the future in the legislation of pesticides removing them from directive 952ec we agree with this and our only desire is that a legal vacuum should not be created as indicated in amendment no 21 and amendment no 4 of the report which was approved in the committee on the environment public health and consumer policy\n",
      "\n",
      "394 mr president commissioner ladies and gentlemen this directive is taking us down a new road until now we had used direct taxation as an instrument of environmental policy and we could have done that here by specifying co2 threshold values for certain types of plant rather than do that we have opted for indirect taxation via pricing and as one finds with indirect taxation here too our problem is that it sets off many side effects that we had not initially wanted that being so commissioner it is the commission's particular responsibility to take matters in hand as regards any such side effects\n",
      "\n",
      "395 mr president we too voted for the compromise on emissions trading because it really is a new tool in the environmental protection armoury one that will in future effectively cap 50 of co2 emissions this provides a unique opportunity and should be regarded as something positive we also welcome the fact that in germany the ministry of economics and labour has not succeeded in securing an exemption from the directive for entire sectors but that we have instead ensured that virtually all sectors of industry are covered and that only certain types of plant with very stringent requirements are exempt which in practice means that none at all are\n",
      "\n",
      "396 mr president the news from britain that the future of the thorp nuclear reprocessing facility is bleak is very welcome from the irish perspective the people of ireland have been totally forthright in their opposition to the existence and expansion of nuclear operations at sellafield i have spoken on this many times in this house over the last 20 years i have had the privilege to visit that plant on behalf of my party in ireland on two occasions one of which was the nirex inquiry\n",
      "\n",
      "397 however we were particularly angered by the imposition of the thorp nuclear reprocessing plant in 1993 the thorp plant has long been a nuclear white elephant for the british people but the people of ireland have been totally opposed to it for many years and will continue to be opposed to it\n",
      "\n",
      "398 it was reported last week that operations at the thorp nuclear reprocessing plant may cease sooner rather than later i hope that the british government gives the necessary clarification in this case i urge you mr president to ask the commission to monitor this situation very closely under the powers vested in it by means of the euratom treaty\n",
      "\n",
      "399 i believe that the reallocation of the structural funds suggested by the commissioner is a good solution to the problem of financing the reforestation and reordering of portugal's plant cover we therefore agree that funds should indeed be reallocated swift action is needed in portugal before this shock is forgotten and this applies to the rest of europe too prevention is the keyword and the golden rule in protecting woodland as several people have already said here today so however is the surveillance and policing of our woodlands as well as heavy penalties for the criminal acts of those who deliberately and intentionally set fire to them the state must take on a new role in reordering and reorganising portuguese woodlands as well as in addressing today's climate related problems throughout europe climate change is a grave threat indeed and steps must be taken immediately\n",
      "\n",
      "400 furthermore the conclusions of the report are extremely important as regards the other challenges we face for example the current economic crisis and the many redundancies associated with it mean that we have to be particularly vigilant about respecting social rights for example we are unfortunately having to contend with the closure of an assembly plant in the somme region of france recent events both in france and in other european companies also demonstrate that the freedom of the press is often violated that certainly happened during the summer heatwave\n",
      "\n",
      "401 concerning more specific points the council made some changes to the nomenclature proposed by the commission in the preliminary draft budget and as in the past rejected the inclusion of the european development fund in the general budget generally speaking it followed the classification proposed by the commission in its preliminary draft budget while emphasising that all expenditure concerning pensions the common agricultural policy veterinary and plant health and international fisheries agreements constitute compulsory expenditure pursuant to the interinstitutional agreement\n",
      "\n",
      "402 finally will he look at the competition implications in the transport business and at the fact that within the united kingdom the majority of railway rolling stock is manufactured outside the country whereas other countries seem quite capable of introducing into their contracts provisions to ensure that rolling stock is made in their own country that is a crucial issue that will affect the future of an excellent railway assembly plant in birmingham where there is no future work at any rate as part of a restructuring process we would like to see those people employed in making trains for the united kingdom market\n",
      "\n",
      "403 here are some examples mr abitbol and i am addressing mr berthu too here of cases in which french companies with the authorisation of the european commission have succeeded in becoming either french national industry leaders or european industry leaders or world industry leaders these are genuine examples and i will confine myself to mentioning cases from recent years total fina elf the result of a merger authorised by the commission has become a major industry leader to say the least in france as has carrefour promodes the merger in the field of nuclear plant engineering between maton and siemens created arriva which a number of members have mentioned this evening a major european industry leader and thanks to the then managing director francis mère the usinor group with the authorisation of the commission merged successfully with other european iron and steel companies to create arcelor which is not the european industry leader but the world industry leader the largest iron and steel group operating in the world today i therefore believe that it is possible to reconcile consumer protection which is the primary task of competition policy with the creation of large structures which can compete at international level in this therefore i agree with mr berthu that we need to have a global vision for global markets although not of course where the markets are still national or local\n",
      "\n",
      "404 i will end mr president with a simple observation if we look back at cases of state aid authorised by the commission for restructuring plans and at the occasions when it was employed we see that in many of those cases the state aid did not help in other words those companies those jobs were not saved in spite of the state aid in those numerous cases the end result was nevertheless job losses plant closures and what is more increased taxation to replenish the state coffers affecting taxpayers\n",
      "\n",
      "405 the commission has also recognised that this proposal to reduce voc emissions is going to have an important effect on the environment it is going to reduce ground level ozone it is going to make sure that we reduce the incidence of asthma caused by ground level ozone it is going to cut plant damage it is going to reduce other environmental effects it has not been easy to come forward with this proposal it has disclosed a large number of technical issues that we had not originally foreseen we thank the commission for tackling those complex issues we did not at first expect\n",
      "\n",
      "406 turning first to parliament's decisions about taking account of the effects on bees and public health of persistent systemic insecticides we have indeed noted those decisions however the commission wishes to stress that any such effect is already taken into account in the evaluation of insecticides required under the directive on the placing of plant protection products on the market member states are not allowed to authorise a plant protection product if it has an unacceptable effect on non target organisms such as bees\n",

      "\n",
      "408 it seems on investigation that this bee mortality is not the result of a conventional pathology several other hypotheses have been examined such as climate general pollution or the incorrect use of plant protection products while these may sometimes carry some of the responsibility however they are far from accounting for the full scale of the disaster on this point i do not agree with the opinion you have just expressed commissioner according to experts and professionals one principal cause has in fact been identified the environment around the hives when it includes fields of honey plants colza sunflower maize the seed of which has been treated with insecticides of the gaucho or regent type\n",
      "\n",
      "409 mr president i will respond briefly to the few comments that have been made contrary to what may have been said the commission takes very seriously this question that mrs lulling has vehemently and competently defended and that mr souchet put with her frankly if some of you have the impression that no serious scientific work has been done on plant protection products and their consequences for bees then i believe you are mistaken work on the substances in question has been going on for several years the international commission on plant bee relations whose particular brief it is to examine the dangers threatening bees has just held an international symposium in bologna on the subject its findings are that the deterioration in the health of bees and the reduced performance of colonies observed in a number of countries probably do not have such a simple single cause other potential sources certain parasitoses certain farming practices and weather conditions may have harmful effects on the health of bees just as much as plant protection and veterinary products\n",
