# bootstrapping-WSD
This is about reduplicating Yarowsky's bootstrapping algorithm (1995) as a semi-supervised approach to Word sense disambiguation.  
The corpus in this project is sourced from [EuroParl](https://www.statmt.org/europarl/)   
However, I only used 2000 files out of around 9000 ones in total because retrieving keywords requires much running time. A too large corpus may make the running time too long.
